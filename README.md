golisp
======

GoLisp is a simple Lisp language and runtime implemented in Google’s
Go programming language. It’s main purpose is integration into a Go
application to provide runtime extension and scripting. The core of a
basic Lisp is provided, but with limited special forms and primitive
functions. More of these will be added as required without having to
modify the GoLisp core. Also, a REPL is provided and GoLisp can be
used as-is to enter and evaluate code.

A complete language reference is available at
